# MusicReviews

The main file to check here is reviews.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook. This uses pitchfork.sqlite and needledrop.csv as sources. 

STATAreviews.do will do the same things but in Stata - it uses premerged.csv as a source.

scrape.py is a draft of a web scraper to get Pitchfork's scores from their site. Not used as a premade data source was found.
