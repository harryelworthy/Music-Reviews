    "<div style=\"text-align: left\"> I read and watch a lot of reviews of music, because I listen to a lot of music and like to get the opinions and ideas of others on the stuff that I listen to. The largest outlet for music reviews (especially hip hop reviews) is Pitchfork, a site which I often feel misrepresents albums and gives too-high number ratings. Anthony Fantano, by contrast, is the \"internet's busiest music nerd,\" the largest online independent music reviewer and cultural icon, going on Youtube by TheNeedleDrop. Fantano and I have many different opinions on music, but I feel like I at least get a more consistent voice out of him, and a more balanced number rating system. As a personal project I wanted to compare the two quantitatively, to see what I could tease out about each of their reviewing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the Pitchfork reviews, I started to build a webscraper (rough draft is in this github folder) but realized that, because Pitchfork's scores are found only on the url of each review, I would have to open more than 24,000 urls, which on home wifi was looking like taking circa 50 hours. Luckily, someone on Kaggle has already done this, and so I use their database, sourced here: https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data. I also borrow some code from this notebook based on the data: https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/is-the-first-album-the-best\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fantano reviews were going to be even harder to scrape, as many are only shown in his youtube reviews. Luckily, a bigger fan than me has already completed this and posted his list to reddit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fantanoforever/comments/6eu3dm/list_of_reviews_album_scores/. This google sheet has been downloaded as needledrop.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Fantano list continues to be maintained, but the Pitchfork data is from 2017, so some recent albums are missing. Note also that while Pitchfork scores with decimals, Fantano scores only in whole numbers. </div>"

This is because some of Fantano's reviews are not reviewed by Pitchfork (and obviously vice versa), and also because some artist/album names are formatted slightly differently. Most of these naming sets are trivial - unicode differences, spaces, etc. - but given so many translated directly (n is still almost 1000!), I didn't feel a need to immediately try to rectify this. It's also reasonable to assume that there is no relation between the albums with small text differences, and (if that's true) we have a large random sample of the population, which should approximate any relationships well enough. Were this a more serious project, this would be something to fix."
